	abstract = {In multi-criteria decision support methods a significant participation of the decision maker is required. The obtained assessment is subjective, and the decision-making process is usually difficult to automate. Limiting interaction with the decision-maker, while maintaining the characteristics of multi-criteria analysis seems to be a desirable direction of methodological research. One of the solutions going in this direction is the original multi-criteria PVM method. The applicability of the method has been verified in the context of research on the assessment of EU countries in terms of ensuring healthy living conditions.},

Operations researchers hardly botheredto ask the decision maker about his or her preferences, assuming that a well-defined singleobjective function was an adequate representation of the decision problem. Many multi-criteriadecision methods began in response to this failure of Operations Research. Othermethods took a totally different and more subjective point of view. In this paper, we discussobjective and subjective descriptions, their interpretation and use in decision making. In thecenter of the ability to distinguish between these objective and subjective components standscientific methods and scientists. We argue that it is possible and necessary to understandwhere and how objective measures should be replaced by subjective measures and judgementin the decision making process.},

	abstract = {In a multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem, qualitative information with subjective judgments of ambiguity is often provided by people, together with quantitative data that may also be imprecise or incomplete. There are several uncertainties that may be considered in an MCDA problem, such as fuzziness and ambiguity. The evidential reasoning (ER) approach is well suited for dealing with such MCDA problems and can generate comprehensive distributed assessments for different alternatives. Many researches in dealing with imprecise or uncertain belief structures have been conducted on the ER approach. In this paper, both triangular fuzzy weights of criteria and fuzzy utilities assigned to evaluation grades are introduced to the ER approach, which may be incurred in several circumstances such as group decision-making situation. The Hadamard multiplicative combination of judgment matrix is extended for the aggregation of triangular fuzzy judgment matrices, the result of which is applied as the fuzzy weights used in the fuzzy ER approach. The consistency of the aggregated triangular fuzzy judgment matrix is also proved. Several pairs of ER-based programming models are designed to generate the total fuzzy belief degrees and the overall expected fuzzy utilities for the comparison of alternatives. A numerical example is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new fuzzy multicriteria decision making (MCDM) approach for evaluating decision alternatives involving subjective judgements made by a group of decision makers. A pairwise comparison process is used to help individual decision makers make comparative judgements, and a linguistic rating method is used for making absolute judgements. A hierarchical weighting method is developed to assess the weights of a large number of evaluation criteria by pairwise comparisons. To reflect the inherent imprecision of subjective judgements, individual assessments are aggregated as a group assessment using triangular fuzzy numbers. To obtain a cardinal preference value for each decision alternative, a new fuzzy MCDM algorithm is developed by extending the concept of the degree of optimality to incorporate criteria weights in the distance measurement. An empirical study of aircraft selection is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},
